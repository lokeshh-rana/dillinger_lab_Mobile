### 3. Software Development Kit (SDK)
- **Android SDK**: A set of tools and libraries required to develop Android applications. It includes:
  - Android Emulator
  - Platform tools
  - Build tools
### 4. Build System
- **Gradle**: The build system used in Android Studio. It manages dependencies, builds APK files, and handles different versions of an app.
### 5. Emulator
- **Android Emulator**: A virtual device that lets developers test their apps without a physical phone.
### 6. User Interface Design
- **XML Layouts**: Used to define the structure of UI components.
- **Jetpack Compose**: A newer toolkit to design UI using Kotlin code in a declarative style.
### 7. Frameworks and Libraries
- **Android Jetpack**: A collection of libraries that help in building robust Android apps. Includes:
  - LiveData
  - ViewModel
  - Room (database)
  - Navigation
  - WorkManager
### 8. Testing
- **JUnit**: Used for unit testing the business logic.
- **Espresso**: Used for UI testing.
- **Robolectric**: Allows running unit tests on JVM without using an emulator.
## iOS Development Environment
### 1. Programming Languages
- **Objective-C**: A legacy programming language for iOS apps.
- **Swift**: A modern and safe programming language developed by Apple.

### 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- **Xcode**: The official IDE for iOS development. It includes a code editor, simulator, and Interface Builder.

### 3. Software Development Kit (SDK)
- **iOS SDK**: Includes essential libraries like:
  - UIKit (UI elements)
  - Foundation (data handling)
  - Core Data (database)

### 4. Build System
- **Xcode Build System**: Manages building, linking, and packaging of iOS apps.

### 5. Simulator
- **iOS Simulator**: Allows developers to test iOS apps on virtual iPhones, iPads, etc.

### 6. User Interface Design
- **Storyboard and XIB**: Visual tools in Xcode for designing user interfaces.
- **SwiftUI**: A modern framework for designing UI using Swift code.

### 7. Frameworks and Libraries
- **Cocoa Touch**: A base framework that includes UIKit, Foundation, and other core libraries.
- **Combine**: A framework to handle asynchronous tasks and event streams.

### 8. Testing
- **XCTest**: Used for both unit testing and UI testing in Xcode.
- **Quick/Nimble**: Popular third-party tools for writing readable tests.

  - Configure device type, system image (API level), and resolution.


## 3. Basic Components of Android Studio

### 1. Welcome Screen
- **Quick Start Options**:
  - Start a new project
  - Open an existing project
  - Clone from GitHub or other version control
- **Recent Projects**: Access previous projects quickly.

### 2. Project Structure

  - Access Java/Kotlin files, resources, Gradle scripts, and manifests.
- **Android View**:
  - Filters project structure to only show relevant Android directories.

### 3. Editor Window
- Primary space to edit code.
- Tab-based interface to switch between files.
- **Split View** support for multitasking.

### 4. Tool Windows
- **Project**: Navigate files and directories.
- **Logcat**: View real-time logs and debugging output.
- **Build**: Monitor build process and errors.
- **Terminal**: Run shell commands directly.
- **Event Log**: Shows background operations like Gradle syncs.

## 4. Creating a Simple Android Project

### Steps to Start a New Project
1. Open Android Studio and select **"Start a new Android Studio project"**.
2. Choose a template (e.g., **Empty Activity**).
3. Fill in project details:
   - Name
   - Package name
   - Save location
   - Language: Java or Kotlin
   - Minimum SDK version

### Exploring the Project Structure
- **`app/java`**: Contains your Java/Kotlin source files.
- **`app/res`**: Contains XML layouts, images, and other resources.
- **`AndroidManifest.xml`**: Declares components and permissions.

### Running the App
- Click the green **Run** button.
- Select a connected device or virtual emulator.
- App will compile, install, and launch.

## 5. Understanding Android App Components
### 1. Activities
- Represent a single screen with a user interface.
- Extend `Activity` or `AppCompatActivity`.

### 2. Layouts
- XML files that define the UI structure.
- Located in `res/layout`.

### 3. Resources
- Include strings (`strings.xml`), colors (`colors.xml`), styles (`styles.xml`), and drawable assets.
- Allow easier localization and design consistency.

### 4. Manifests
- The `AndroidManifest.xml` file contains:
  - App name and icon
  - Activities, services, broadcast receivers
  - Permissions (e.g., Internet, camera)

### 5. Gradle Scripts
- Used for build configuration and dependencies.
- `build.gradle (Project)`: Configuration for all modules.
- `build.gradle (Module: app)`: App-specific dependencies and settings.

## Additional Features that u can add
